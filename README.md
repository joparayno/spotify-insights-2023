# üé∂ Analyzing Trends in Spotify's Top Songs of 2023 using Exploratory Data Analysis

> This project explores Spotify's top songs of 2023 by performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA). With the help of Python, we'll be able to examine the trends, correlations, and key factors such as the number of streams, release dates, and musical attributes. Findings from this analysis aim to offer valuable insights into the elements that drive a track‚Äôs success on streaming platforms.

Before we begin the Data Analysis, we must first import the required libraries, download the csv file [View CSV Data](https://github.com/joparayno/spotify-insights-2023/blob/main/Most%20Streamed%20Spotify%202023.csv), and use the pd.read_csv() function to load the csv into a Pandas DataFrame.

  ```python
  import numpy as np
  import pandas as pd
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import seaborn as sns
  
  df = pd.read_csv("Most Streamed Spotify 2023.csv", encoding='latin-1')
  df
  ```

## Overview of Dataset
- How many rows and columns does the dataset contain?
  ```python
  rows, columns = df.shape # Provides the number of rows and columns of the DataFrame
  print("The dataset contains", rows, "rows and", columns, "columns.")
  ```
  **Output**:
  ```
  The dataset contains 953 rows and 24 columns.
  ```
   
- What are the data types of each column? Are there any missing values?
  ```python
  
  print("Data types of each column:")
  print(df.dtypes) # Describes each column‚Äôs data type.

  missing_values = df.isnull().sum() # Counts the number of missing values on the dataset.
  print("\nMissing values in each column:")
  print(missing_values)
  ```
  **Output**:
  ```
  Data types of each column:

## Basic Descriptive Statistics
- What are the mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams column?
  ```python
  # Converts the 'streams' column to numeric values, coercing any errors to NaN
  df['streams'] = pd.to_numeric(df['streams'], errors='coerce')
  df = df.dropna(subset=['streams'])

  # Shows the summary statistics for each column
  df.describe()
  statsum = df['streams'].describe() # Shows the statistics of the 'streams' column
  print("Summary of Streams: ")
  print(statsum)
  ```
  **Output**:
  ```
  Summary of Streams: 
  count    9.520000e+02
  mean     5.141374e+08
  std      5.668569e+08
  min      2.762000e+03
  25%      1.416362e+08
  50%      2.905309e+08
  75%      6.738690e+08
  max      3.703895e+09
  Name: streams, dtype: float64
  ```
  With the provided output, we can get the mean value as 5.141374e+08, the median (50%) as 2.905309e+08, and the standard deviation as 5.668569e+08.
  
- What is the distribution of released_year and artist_count? Are there any noticeable trends or outliers?
  ```python
  fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(14, 10))

  # Histogram for 'released_year'
  sns.histplot(df['released_year'], bins=20, stat='count', ax=axes[0, 0], color='skyblue')
  axes[0, 0].set_title('Released Year')
  axes[0, 0].set_xlabel('Released Year')

  # Box plot for 'released_year'
  sns.boxplot(x=df['released_year'], ax=axes[1, 0], color='lightblue', width=0.6)
  axes[1, 0].set_title('Released Year - Outliers')

  # Histogram for 'artist_count'
  sns.histplot(df['artist_count'], bins=15, stat='count', ax=axes[0, 1], color='salmon')
  axes[0, 1].set_title('Artist Count')
  axes[0, 1].set_xlabel('Artist Count')

  # Box plot for 'artist_count'
  sns.boxplot(x=df['artist_count'], ax=axes[1, 1], color='lightcoral', width=0.6)
  axes[1, 1].set_title('Artist Count - Outliers')

  plt.tight_layout()
  plt.show()
  ```

- Who are the top 5 most frequent artists based on the number of tracks in the dataset?
  ```python
  artists = df['artist(s)_name']
  artist = []

  # Separate multiple artists by commas, stripping extra spaces.
  for i in artists:
    for ix in i.split(','):
        artist.append(ix.strip()) 

  # Determines the top 5 frequent artists.
  freq_art = pd.DataFrame(artist, columns=['Artists']).value_counts().reset_index(name='Number of Songs').iloc[:5]

  sns.barplot(x='Artists', y='Number of Songs', data=freq_art)
  plt.show()
  ```

## Temporal Trends
- Analyze the trends in the number of tracks released over time. Plot the number of tracks released per year.
  ```python
  spotify_yr = df.groupby('released_year').size() # Counts the songs per release year.

  plt.plot(spotify_yr) # Plots the number of songs released each year as a line plot.
  ```

- Does the number of tracks released per month follow any noticeable patterns? Which month sees the most releases?
  ```python
  month_pattern = df.groupby('released_month').size() # Groups the data by 'released_month' column and count the number of occurences for each month.
  
  plt.plot(month_pattern) # Plots the pattern of the data.
  ```

## Genre and Music Characteristics
- Examine the correlation between streams and musical attributes like bpm, danceability_%, and energy_%. Which attributes seem to influence streams the most?
  ```python
  features = ['bpm', 'danceability_%', 'energy_%', 'valence_%', 'acousticness_%', 'instrumentalness_%', 'liveness_%', 'speechiness_%']

  fig, axes = plt.subplots(4, 2, figsize=(20, 14)) # Create subplots for each feature
  axes = axes.flatten()

  for i, feature in enumerate(features): # Plot streams for each feature
    df.groupby(feature)['streams'].sum().sort_index().plot(ax=axes[i], label=feature)
    axes[i].legend()

  plt.tight_layout()
  plt.show()
  ```
  **Output**:

- Is there a correlation between danceability_% and energy_%? How about valence_% and acousticness_%?
  ```python
  musical_attr = df[features]

  # Customize the pairplot
  sns.pairplot(
    musical_attr,
    plot_kws={
        'alpha': 0.3,        
        's': 70,
        'marker': 'o'
    }
  )
  ```

## Platform Popularity
- How do the numbers of tracks in spotify_playlists, spotify_charts, and apple_playlists compare? Which platform seems to favor the most popular tracks?
  ```python
  sources = ['in_spotify_playlists','in_spotify_charts', 'in_apple_playlists']

  track_sums = [df[src].sum() for src in sources] # Sum the tracks for each source

  data = pd.DataFrame({'Platform': sources, 'Tracks': track_sums})

  sns.barplot(x='Platform', y='Tracks', data=data); # Plot the results
  ```
  **Output**:

## Advanced Analysis
- Based on the streams data, can you identify any patterns among tracks with the same key or mode (Major vs. Minor)?
  ```python
  # Get the sum of all streams per key
  strkey = df.groupby('key')['streams'].sum()

  strms_df = strkey.reset_index()
  strkey.columns = ['key', 'streams']

  sns.barplot(x='key', y='streams', data=strms_df);
  ```
  **Output**:

- Do certain genres or artists consistently appear in more playlists or charts? Perform an analysis to compare the most frequently appearing artists in playlists or charts.
  ```python
  filtered_df = df.copy()  # Make a copy of the original DataFrame

  platforms = [
    'in_spotify_playlists', 
    'in_spotify_charts', 
    'in_apple_playlists', 
    'in_apple_charts', 
    'in_deezer_playlists',
    'in_deezer_charts',
    'in_shazam_charts'
  ]

  # Create subplots for each platform
  fig, axes = plt.subplots(4, 2, figsize=(20, 18)) 
  axes = axes.flatten()

  for i, platform in enumerate(platforms):
    # Ensure the column is numeric and handle missing values
    filtered_df[platform] = pd.to_numeric(filtered_df[platform], errors='coerce').fillna(0)

    # Group, sum, and sort values.
    artists = filtered_df.groupby('artist(s)_name')[platform].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).reset_index()
    
    sns.barplot(x='artist(s)_name', y=platform, data=artists.head(), ax=axes[i])

  for j in range(len(platforms), len(axes)):
    axes[j].axis('off')

  plt.tight_layout()  
  plt.show()  
  ```
  **Output**:
