Before we begin the Data Analysis, we must first import the required libraries, download the csv file [View CSV Data](https://github.com/joparayno/spotify-insights-2023/blob/main/Most%20Streamed%20Spotify%202023.csv), and use the pd.read_csv() function to load the csv into a Pandas DataFrame.

  ```python
  import numpy as np
  import pandas as pd
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import seaborn as sns
  
  df = pd.read_csv("Most Streamed Spotify 2023.csv", encoding='latin-1')
  df
  ```

## Overview of Dataset
- How many rows and columns does the dataset contain?
  ```python
  rows, columns = df.shape # Provide the number of rows and columns of the DataFrame
  print("The dataset contains", rows, "rows and", columns, "columns.")
  ```
  **Output**:
  ```
  The dataset contains 953 rows and 24 columns.
  ```
  > Dataset consists of 953 rows and 24 columns.
 
- What are the data types of each column? Are there any missing values?
  ```python
  print("Data types of each column:")
  print(df.dtypes) # Describe each column‚Äôs data type.

  missing_values = df.isnull().sum() # Count the number of missing values on the dataset.
  print("\nMissing values in each column:")
  print(missing_values)

## Basic Descriptive Statistics
- What are the mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams column?
  ```python
  # Convert the 'streams' column to numeric values, coercing any errors to NaN
  df['streams'] = pd.to_numeric(df['streams'], errors='coerce')
  df = df.dropna(subset=['streams'])

  # Show the summary statistics for each column
  df.describe()
  statsum = df['streams'].describe() # Shows the statistics of the 'streams' column
  print("Summary of Streams: ")
  print(statsum)
  ```
  **Output**:
  ```
  Summary of Streams: 
  count    9.520000e+02
  mean     5.141374e+08
  std      5.668569e+08
  min      2.762000e+03
  25%      1.416362e+08
  50%      2.905309e+08
  75%      6.738690e+08
  max      3.703895e+09
  Name: streams, dtype: float64
  ```
  > With the provided output, we can get the mean value as 5.141374e+08, the median (50%) as 2.905309e+08, and the standard deviation as 5.668569e+08.
  
- What is the distribution of released_year and artist_count? Are there any noticeable trends or outliers?
  ```python
  fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(14, 10))

  # Histogram for 'released_year'
  sns.histplot(df['released_year'], bins=20, stat='count', ax=axes[0, 0], color='skyblue')
  axes[0, 0].set_title('Released Year')
  axes[0, 0].set_xlabel('Released Year')

  # Box plot for 'released_year'
  sns.boxplot(x=df['released_year'], ax=axes[1, 0], color='lightblue', width=0.6)
  axes[1, 0].set_title('Released Year - Outliers')

  # Histogram for 'artist_count'
  sns.histplot(df['artist_count'], bins=15, stat='count', ax=axes[0, 1], color='salmon')
  axes[0, 1].set_title('Artist Count')
  axes[0, 1].set_xlabel('Artist Count')

  # Box plot for 'artist_count'
  sns.boxplot(x=df['artist_count'], ax=axes[1, 1], color='lightcoral', width=0.6)
  axes[1, 1].set_title('Artist Count - Outliers')

  plt.tight_layout()
  plt.show()

  > With the gathered information for the Top Hits, most songs are concentrated towards recent years, especially from the 2000s onward. This suggests that the most popular streamed songs in the dataset are recent. Outliers exist in earlier years, going back to the 1940s, which could represent older classic songs that have remained popular or experienced a resurgence in streaming popularity. Clustering for recent years indicates that more recent releases are more commonly represented among popular streams. Most songs have an artist count between 1 and 3, with a strong concentration around single-artist songs. Outliers with higher artist counts, up to 8, likely indicate collaborations or songs with multiple featured artists, which may be less common. The high concentration of single-artist entries aligns with the music industry trend of individual artist dominance, but the presence of outliers suggests the popularity of collaborative tracks in recent years.

## Temporal Trends
- Analyze the trends in the number of tracks released over time. Plot the number of tracks released per year.
  ```python
  spotify_yr = df.groupby('released_year').size() # Count the songs per release year.

  plt.plot(spotify_yr) # Plot the number of songs released each year as a line plot.
  ```
  **Output**:
  
  ![Screenshot 2024-11-03 at 2 12 15‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc78cf7b-108a-4d24-a99e-79090499bc82)

  > We can observe a significant increase in the number of tracks released in the year 2020. This surge might be attributed to the data collected and the specific year of release.
  
- Does the number of tracks released per month follow any noticeable patterns? Which month sees the most releases?
  ```python
  month_pattern = df.groupby('released_month').size() # Group the data by 'released_month' column and count the number of occurences for each month.
  
  plt.plot(month_pattern) # Plot the pattern of the data.
  ```
  **Output**:
  
  ![Screenshot 2024-11-03 at 10 48 23‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bc033ed-eaa1-4d56-b90b-09b3c6ec4131)

  > It appears that January and May are the best months for releasing new songs, as they have the highest number of releases compared to August, which has the lowest.
 
## Genre and Music Characteristics
- Examine the correlation between streams and musical attributes like bpm, danceability_%, and energy_%. Which attributes seem to influence streams the most?
  ```python
  features = ['bpm', 'danceability_%', 'energy_%', 'valence_%', 'acousticness_%', 'instrumentalness_%', 'liveness_%', 'speechiness_%']

  fig, axes = plt.subplots(4, 2, figsize=(20, 14)) # Create subplots for each feature
  axes = axes.flatten()

  for i, feature in enumerate(features): # Plot streams for each feature
    df.groupby(feature)['streams'].sum().sort_index().plot(ax=axes[i], label=feature)
    axes[i].legend()

  plt.tight_layout()
  plt.show()
  ```
  **Output**:

  ![Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 12 17 24‚ÄØAM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40c99974-c7e3-4890-bc45-d6c6ec254e65)

  > The plots demonstrate the correlation between streams and various musical attributes. For instance, the beats per minute (BPM) reached a peak of 120. The danceability percentage peaked at 60% and 80%. Users generally prefer music with higher energy levels. The valence was predominantly distributed around 50%. The acousticness gradually decreased as acousticness increased. Individuals preferred music with minimal instrumental elements. The liveliness reached a peak of 10 but subsequently declined. Lastly, the speechiness was only 5% initially but rapidly decreased as it increased.

- Is there a correlation between danceability_% and energy_%? How about valence_% and acousticness_%?
  ```python
  musical_attr = df[features]

  # Customize the pairplot
  sns.pairplot(
    musical_attr,
    plot_kws={
        'alpha': 0.3,        
        's': 70,
        'marker': 'o'
    }
  )
  ```
  **Output**:

  ![Screenshot 2024-11-03 at 11 09 54‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e69d0787-6e98-4005-a4c0-b19eaa91c880)

  > Based on the output generated by the pairplot, it appears that there exists a correlation between danceability_% and energy_%. Specifically, a higher energy level is associated with a higher danceability_%. Furthermore, valence_% and danceability_% exhibit a stronger positive correlation compared to danceability_% and energy_%. Additionally, there is a significantly stronger positive correlation between valence and energy.

## Platform Popularity
- How do the numbers of tracks in spotify_playlists, spotify_charts, and apple_playlists compare? Which platform seems to favor the most popular tracks?
  ```python
  sources = ['in_spotify_playlists','in_spotify_charts', 'in_apple_playlists']

  track_sums = [df[src].sum() for src in sources] # Sum the tracks for each source

  data = pd.DataFrame({'Platform': sources, 'Tracks': track_sums})

  sns.barplot(x='Platform', y='Tracks', data=data); # Plot the results
  ```
  **Output**:

  ![Screenshot 2024-11-03 at 2 19 37‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f339c3af-0776-4f9c-9703-e9be94ab21d0)

  > It appears that Spotify offers the most favorable platform for the most popular tracks.
  
## Advanced Analysis
- Based on the streams data, can you identify any patterns among tracks with the same key or mode (Major vs. Minor)?
  ```python
  # Get the sum of all streams per key
  strkey = df.groupby('key')['streams'].sum()

  strms_df = strkey.reset_index()
  strkey.columns = ['key', 'streams']

  sns.barplot(x='key', y='streams', data=strms_df);
  ```
  **Output**:

  ![Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 12 08 05‚ÄØAM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d8a8967-b05e-4f86-9efc-a1220f1aef13)

  > C# dominates all keys, making it the most frequently used key in streamed songs. Also, some keys have the same amount of use.

- Do certain genres or artists consistently appear in more playlists or charts? Perform an analysis to compare the most frequently appearing artists in playlists or charts.
  ```python
  filtered_df = df.copy()  # Make a copy of the original DataFrame

  platforms = [
    'in_spotify_playlists', 
    'in_spotify_charts', 
    'in_apple_playlists', 
    'in_apple_charts', 
    'in_deezer_playlists',
    'in_deezer_charts',
    'in_shazam_charts'
  ]

  # Create subplots for each platform
  fig, axes = plt.subplots(4, 2, figsize=(20, 18)) 
  axes = axes.flatten()

  for i, platform in enumerate(platforms):
    # Ensure the column is numeric and handle missing values
    filtered_df[platform] = pd.to_numeric(filtered_df[platform], errors='coerce').fillna(0)

    # Group, sum, and sort values.
    artists = filtered_df.groupby('artist(s)_name')[platform].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).reset_index()
    
    sns.barplot(x='artist(s)_name', y=platform, data=artists.head(), ax=axes[i])

  for j in range(len(platforms), len(axes)):
    axes[j].axis('off')

  plt.tight_layout()  
  plt.show()  
  ```
  **Output**:

  ![Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 12 46 30‚ÄØAM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3fa5ce2-362e-4aae-842a-4860001b8c09)

## Conclusion

  Our analysis of the Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023 dataset has provided valuable insights into what makes a track popular on different streaming platforms. By examining trends, musical characteristics, and platform comparisons, we identified several factors that contribute to the success of these top tracks.

  - Key: C# is identified as the most popular key, with the highest number of streams associated with it.
  - Mode: Tracks in the Major mode tend to be preferred in terms of popularity.
  - BPM: A tempo within the heart rate range, ideally around 120 BPM, is recommended for wider appeal, as it's upbeat but not overly fast.
  - Energy: For a song to gain popularity, it should have moderate to high energy, generally within the 50-80% range.
  - Danceability: Songs that are danceable are generally better suited to capture and retain an audience.
  - Valence: Adding a positive feel or "vibe" to your song can increase its appeal, as listeners tend to favor songs with an upbeat tone.
  - Acousticness: Lowering acousticness can be beneficial, as highly acoustic tracks typically don't perform as well in terms of popularity.
  - Instrumentalness: Minimizing instrumental elements can make the track more relatable to a wider audience, as fully instrumental tracks may not connect as strongly with listeners.
  - Liveness: Tracks with lower liveness values tend to perform better, as high liveness can detract from mainstream appeal.
  - Speechiness: Similar to liveness, keeping speechiness low can make the song more appealing to listeners.
  - Platform Choice: Selecting the right streaming platform is crucial for reaching a broad audience and enhancing a song‚Äôs popularity.

  As streaming continues to shape the music industry, leveraging these insights can help artists create tracks that resonate widely and stand out in an increasingly competitive digital landscape.
